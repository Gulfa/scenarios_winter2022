# Simple immunity model

This folder contains a simple model to generate a distribution of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity for the population. 

## Not included: vaccination data
Due to privacy, we are not sharing the true vaccination data used when the scenarios were generated. We do include a dummy file with false data just to illustrate the required file format. Hence, running this code in its present state will not generate the same scenarios as those used by the infection model. (But the correct, aggregated scenario files used by the infection model are included in the model folders in this repository.) If you want to run this simple immunity model using real data, you have to contact SYSVAK, or consider manually combining the publicly available data on the SYSVAK website and through https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/surveillance_data, which may well give an estimate that is good enough for the purpose.
